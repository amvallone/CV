	abstract = {As scientific collaboration becomes increasingly global and complex, understanding the network mechanisms underlying gender disparities in innovation is essential. While prior research has often examined single disciplines or national contexts, this study integrates social network analysis and regression modeling to explore how gender, homophily, and network position interact to shape inventive outcomes. Using a 30-year panel of 3,871,017 U.S. patents (1990–2019) and 2,631,166 inventors, we distinguish between star inventors – those in the top productivity and citation percentiles – and non-star inventors to assess whether network advantages operate uniformly across performance strata. Results reveal three key patterns. First, women occupy less central positions and experience productivity gaps in aggregate models. Second, even with star status, top-performing women receive fewer citations than men, indicating that exceptional output does not offset systemic disadvantage. When network–gender interactions are introduced, the female–star coefficient loses significance, suggesting that the observed productivity premium among female stars stems primarily from positional advantages rather than star status itself. Third, men’s networks exhibit stronger homophily, whereas women rely on heterophilic ties – beneficial for productivity but less so for visibility. These findings extend theories of cumulative advantage, showing that structural capital alone cannot neutralize inequities in innovation systems.},

	abstract = {Northern Chile is the scenario of two main activities from a social and economic point of view the: brown seaweeds fishery and cooper mining industry. Chilean brown seaweeds of economic importance, commonly known as kelps, constitute a multi-specific fishery with a workforce of 15,000 people. Four species of kelps are harvested from natural populations by artisanal fishers and exported to world markets as raw material for alginate extraction. On the other hand, copper mining production, contributes 36 \% of GDP and it is the major Chilean export commodity. Due to the non-existence of entry barriers to seaweed extraction, this activity has become the sink for unemployment in northern Chile mainly from mining activity. In this context, our results show that when the price of copper is in a downward cycle, it negatively affects the abundance of brown seaweeds, due to the mobility of the workforce to the coastline, increasing the illegal harvest of these marine resources. In contrast, the upward cycle of copper decreases the harvesting pressure, removing illegal harvesters from the coastline and returning them to a mining industry and its suppliers with better wages. These drivers would generate a temporary window for recovery and restoration of brown algae populations, as well as the numerous ecosystem services provided by these engineering organisms.},

  abstract={We utilize exploratory techniques to identify patterns in pesticide use spatial and temporal dimensions. Using data on 149 countries from 1993 to 2020, we find that some countries with low pesticide use are “catching-up” slightly. From a Markov chain analysis, we also note that the distribution of pesticide use per hectare is characterized by a low inter-class mobility, more pronounced in the head and tail of the distribution. This suggests a lock-in phenomenon once “unsustainable” agricultural systems are adopted. We complement this temporal analysis by exploring the role of “proximity” between countries in the use of pesticides and its dynamics. Three definitions of proximity are considered. The first is geographical, the second and third are based on crops produced at the country level and on countries’ GDP per capita respectively. Our results suggest that countries’ economic development explains more pesticide use than their geographic proximity or their crop similarity.},

The main objective of this manuscript is to estimate the carbon footprint of the La Serena-Coquimbo conurbation, seeking to determine the contribution of the area to climate change. To this end, the following steps were taken: Identification of sectors and subsectors contributing to GHG emissions in the conurbation; gathering data on selected sectors to develop a GHG inventory; and the quantification of the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) in selected sectors. The results revealed that 2,102,887 t CO2eq were generated in the conurbation by the stationary energy, transport, and waste sectors, the former being the largest contributor. We conclude that there is a need for greater environmental development in cities in order to facilitate formulation and implementation of GHG reduction proposals.},

We study changes in the configurations of different technology fields via the power-law, small-world, preferential attachment, shrinking diameter, densification law, and gelling point hypotheses. Similar to the existing literature, we obtain mixed results. Based on network statistics, we argue that the sudden rise of large networks in six technology sectors can be understood as a phase transition in which small, isolated networks form one giant component. In two other technology sectors, such a transition occurred much later and much less dramatically. The examination of inventor networks over time reveals the increased complexity of all technology sectors, regardless of the individual characteristics of the network. Therefore, we introduce ideas associated with the technological diversification of inventors to complement our analysis, and we find evidence that inventors tend to diversify into new fields that are less mature. This behavior appears to be correlated with the compliance of some of the expected network rules and has implications for the emerging patterns among the different collaboration networks under consideration here.},

The six-step method based on a set of statistical methods can be computed with a new R package: estdaR. The first step consists of the usual characterization of the cross-sectional distribution of the urban areas by means of nonparametric estimations of density functions for a set of significant years. In the second and third steps, the growth process is modeled as a first-order stationary Markov chain to evaluate the effect of global and local spatial autocorrelation on the transition probabilities with a set of indices based on the spatial version of the standard Markov chain. The fourth, fifth, and sixth steps perform in-depth analysis to detect the existence and interaction of spatial regimes in the movement direction and ranking mobility of urban distribution. We apply this novel strategy for the period 1930–2002 to analyze the entire Chilean urban system—not only the Central Zone, in which most of the population and economic activities are concentrated, but also other urban zones in the country.},

We show that these networks exhibit power-law, small-world, and preferential attachment properties, all of which have been used to describe networks in more advanced economies. We also highlight some apparent differences in collaboration patterns between networks (and inventors) and we reveal the precarious nature of the network of local inventors by confirming the community structure property. Evidence for strong positive autocorrelation between highly and lowly productive inventors is presented via methods used in spatial econometrics. Our results show that the inventor system in Chile is highly fragmented, which emphasizes the need for strong government intervention in steering research funding, and for more collaboration between inventors, especially local ones.},

Second, when comparing these results with those obtained for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, we show that the convergence pattern detected with GDP per capita is more pronounced: ECO-DEV adjusts slower over time compared to GDP per capita.

	abstract = {Since the introduction of the World Wide Web in the 1990s, available information for research purposes has increased exponentially, leading to a significant proliferation of research based on web-enabled data. Nowadays the use of internet-enabled databases, obtained by either primary data online surveys or secondary official and non-official registers, is common. However, information disposal varies depending on data category and country and specifically, the collection of microdata at low geographical level for urban analysis can be a challenge. The most common difficulties when working with secondary web-enabled data can be grouped into two categories: accessibility and availability problems. Accessibility problems are present when the data publication in the servers blocks or delays the download process, which becomes a tedious reiterative task that can produce errors in the construction of big databases. Availability problems usually arise when official agencies restrict access to the information for statistical confidentiality reasons. In order to overcome some of these problems, this paper presents different strategies based on URL parsing, PDF text extraction, and web scraping. A set of functions, which are available under a GPL-2 license, were built in an R package to specifically extract and organize databases at the municipality level (NUTS 5) in Spain for population, unemployment, vehicle fleet, and firm characteristics.},

Using a dataset of invention patents granted by the Chilean National Institute of Industrial Property (INAPI), the study examines patent origins, technological specialization, and grant lags. Results show that patenting in Chile is highly concentrated among large foreign companies, with domestic contributions increasing but still modest. Universities account for a very small share of patents, reflecting limited science-industry interaction. Patent grant lags are long—averaging nearly seven years—but shortened after Chile’s accession to the Patent Cooperation Treaty in 2005. Social network analysis reveals scarce collaboration, with joint patents representing only a minor fraction of total activity. Overall, Chile’s patent ecosystem appears fragmented, poorly connected, and dominated by non-resident entities, highlighting structural weaknesses in innovation and collaboration. The findings underscore the need for stronger policies to foster domestic patenting capacity and encourage partnerships between universities, local firms, and international corporations.},

Whereas the concentration excess has problems associated with social welfare due to the existence of regional disparities and the congestion in some cities, the dispersion does not take advantage of, for example, the benefits of reducing costs of production generated by economies of scale.
Several studies have been performed in order to give an explanation to the fulfillment of Zipfs law, where the top-down models, that force the fulfillment of Zipfs law, have dominated the literature. Some proposals have attempted to explain the fulfillment of Zipf using cellular automata. These bottom-up proposals generate the distribution and sizes of cities in an emergent way. However, these models are not flexible and extensible, therefore, these proposals cannot be adapted to different geographical areas.
This paper proposes an initial implementation of a flexible and extensible model based on cellular automata, called CityCA, which tries to explain the Zipf coefficient. CityCA was evaluated and adapted to a real scenario, Chile. The simulation results were as expected, since they show that the ratio is closer to Zipf over-concentration than the dispersion, as in reality. With this model and implementation, urban economists do not require advanced programming knowledge, since CityCA already integrates specific knowledge.},
